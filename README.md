## There are different kinds of bash commands.
### Some of them:
*`git config` - _Usage:_ `git config –global user.name “[name]”`
*Usage:* `git config –global user.email “[email address]”` 
With Git, there are many configurations and settings possible. git config is how to assign these settings. Two important settings are user user.name and user.email. These values set what email address and name commits will be from on a local computer. With git config, a --global flag is used to write the settings to all repositories on a computer. Without a --global flag settings will only apply to the current repository that you are currently in.
*`git init` -
*`git add` -
*`git commit` -
*`git push` -
*`git clone` -
